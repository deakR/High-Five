## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) (for your own deployment)

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/deakR/High-Five.git
   cd High-Five
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**

   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - In your project settings, add a new web app and copy the Firebase config.

4. **Configure environment variables:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```
     VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     VITE_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
     VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     ```
   - **Note:** Never commit your `.env` file. It is already in `.gitignore`.

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## ‚ö° Troubleshooting

- **Blank page or Firebase errors:** Double-check your `.env` values and make sure your Firebase project is set up correctly.
- **CORS issues:** Make sure your Firebase Firestore rules allow read/write for development.
- **API for countries/cities not loading:** The app uses [countriesnow.space](https://countriesnow.space/) API. If it‚Äôs down, country/city selection may not work.
